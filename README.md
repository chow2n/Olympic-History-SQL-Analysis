## Analysis of 120 years of Olympic athlete history in PostgreSQL

In this repository, I will be taking a look at a [historical dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results) that features Olympic athlete data from Athens 1860 to Rio 2016. This dataset has over 250,000 rows in two tables. The dataset contains information on competing athletes from all across the world. Information such as name, sex, age, height, weight, nationality, sport, medals, and more are present in the dataset.

### Purpose:
It may be interesting to analyze this dataset to see how the Olympic games have evolved over the years and what kind of insights we can gain by using SQL to analyze the dataset. Another purpose of this analysis is is for myself to get familiar with PostgreSQL and pgAdmin specifically. I would also like to challenge myself and use more complex SQL queries like complex windows functions and CTE functions.
